React.createElement(type, {props}, ...children);

Components

props
What’s important to realize about props is three things. 
First, they are always passed down from a parent component to a child. 
Second, props are only given to the child component when it’s being created.
rops can’t be changed once they are passed to the child and the component is created with them, but nothing says the component can’t be destroyed and recreated with all-new prop values, and that’s precisely what happens under the covers.
